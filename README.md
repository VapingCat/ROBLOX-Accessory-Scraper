# ROBLOX-Accessory-Scraper
just copy the loadstring or copy and execute the source in synapse x or scriptware and it should work (no promises)
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VapingCat/ROBLOX-Accessory-Scraper/main/script.lua"))()
```
be kind and not steal it (i cant stop u)
